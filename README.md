# IRTM-Synth 

Welcome to the IRT-M Sythn repository! This is an R and Python repository to create realistic synthetic survey datasets for research and testing purposes.

## Overview:

With this repository, we are attempting to resolve a problem with the use and distribution of example data for new methods and utilities. 
On the one hand, as social scientists we understand the expense and labor entailed in creating original survey datasets. Data is not free to create, and so the originators often (justifiably!) would like to control the release of that data.

On the other, as methodologists, we also understand that new tools require applied examples. New packages and applications need to include data in vignettes.

Here we are creating a synthetic version of existing data to serve as training examples, with references and links to the original datasets so that reseachers and users can use (and credit) the original data in their applications.

## Features:

We use Python in a Jupyter Project for data preparation, [YData-synthetic](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic) in a Google Colab notebook to create the synthetic data.
The synthetic data is incorporated into an RMarkdown file for illustration.
